Fraud Detection Analysis using Machine learning models

The steps involved in the project are:

1. exploring the dataset also visualizing as well as cleaning the data set.

2. Data preprocessing.

3. building machine learning models.

4. evaluating the models.

5.tuning the parameters for better accuracy.

6.upsampling- Upsampling (balanced): decide how many times the sample size of the minority class wants to be used and perform sampling with replacement in the minority class and sampling without replacement in the majority class.

7.final model creation and analysis outcome.
